# Introduction
Hi guys! Welcome to my philosophical digital garden. The contents of this site, which continuously tended upon by its gardener, that's me, will be my metaphysical musings. I am an ardent follower of the classical Advaita Vedanta and count my blessings that thanks to the wonders of technology I have come across this ageless philosophy.
I want to spread this wonderful word!

# Spirituality demystified
I have often contemplated what defines a man? I cannot be outward appearance, nor can it be intelligence, wealth and so on. I settled then on morals. A man is defined by his morals so I thought. Later I realized it cannot be even morals. What then? It must belief! A man is defined by his beliefs. Freedom then, which is undefined, must be freedom of beliefs. Or being able to maintain distance from thought. And to this is to my understanding what Advaita Vedanta so elegantly points to.

## The Four Levels
I identify four levels in our spiritual development. But first perhaps I should explain why we should pursue spirituality in the first place. Well, don't we all pursue happiness in our own ways? The Advaita Vedanta promises we can obtain untold happiness by realizing ourselves as pure unblemished eternal ever present brightly intelligent consciousness.
So evidently we should pursue this unsurpassed happiness if we are rational beings.
Coming back to the four levels, they are:
1. Instinct. The only motivation is gratification of the instinctual desires.
2. Culture. Through education people on this level (and most of us are), recognize religion and spirituality as important themes, but are too involved in the world to focus their attention on inner development.
3. Awakening. On this level there has been a recognition of suffering and questions arise about how to take away the suffering, coupled with a strong belief that answers to those questions can be found.
4. Practice. At this level awakening to the Truth has already taken place (it is is the transition from level 3 to 4). What remains to be left done is shadow-work. Extinguishing all traces of Big Ego.
